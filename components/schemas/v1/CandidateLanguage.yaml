  # todo sm for example CEFR uses a scale A1, A2, B1, B2, C1, C2 which loosely maps to:
  # todo sm Beginner, Elementary, Intermediate, Upper Intermediate, Advanced, Mastery/Native-like; or, using our names:
  # todo sm A1+A2: Elementary Proficiency, B1+B2: Intermediate Proficiency, C1: Full Professional Proficiency, C2: Native or Bilingual Proficiency

  migrationLanguage: # todo confirm the semantics and relevance of this field
    #    todo jc Not sure but I think that "migration" here refers to migration of data from the old (2019) database.
    #    todo jc If so, I would be inclined to leave it out
    # todo sm Ok - in prod we have 274 instances of values in this field where the corresponding language is "Unknown"
    # todo sm I think migrationLanguage can be removed from the API and the corresponding language_id correctly mapped as far as possible
