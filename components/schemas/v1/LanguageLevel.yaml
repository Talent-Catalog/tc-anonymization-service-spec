    # todo jc  This is our non standard level. This table is just to restrict allowed values.
    #    todo jc It could be treated like an enum.
#     todo sm I'm not sure but thinking if we should use the CEFR scale for the API language levels - see comments in CandidateLanguage.yaml
#    todo sm I note that the Duolingo platform uses the CEFR scale for some of its courses, e.g. French, Spanish and English, possible others
#    todo sm see: https://blog.duolingo.com/goldilocks-and-the-cefr-levels-which-proficiency-level-is-just-right/#:~:text=At%20Duolingo%2C%20we%20use%20the,coverage%2C%20from%20A1%20to%20B2.
#    todo sm we could add a cefr_level column to the langauge_level table in the database, and expose this value in the API instead of our non standard levels?
