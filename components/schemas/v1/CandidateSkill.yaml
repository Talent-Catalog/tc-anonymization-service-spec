properties:
  # todo - decide on a standard skills taxonomy e.g. https://www.bls.gov/soc/2018/major_groups.htm
#  todo jc We should stick with ISCO codes
  # todo sm I think ISCO focuses on occupations rather than skills. I think sooner or later we will need a skills taxonomy.
  # todo sm ISCO International Standard Classification of Occupations supports broad occupation categories, drilling down into more specific occupational areas, roles and tasks; but not skills as such
  # todo sm using ISCO in conjunction with a taxonomy such as ESCO in particular (Eurpoean Skills, Competences, Qualifications and Occupations) could be the way to go
  # todo sm for example ISCO code 2512 ("Software Developers") in ESCO links to specific skills like "Java programming," "Python," "define technical requirements" etc.
  # todo sm see: https://esco.ec.europa.eu/en/classification/occupation?uri=http://data.europa.eu/esco/occupation/f2b15a0e-e65a-438a-affb-29b9d50b77d1
  # todo sm in the future this could be a basis for automated candidate skills interviews (possibly as a CASI service)
  # todo ESCO, currently 13939 skills, updates its dataset regularly, potentially providing a future-proof skills taxonomy
#  todo sm+jc - open a ticket to check if we are still populating the candidate_skill table + do we prompt candidates to update the table (JC will take this) - is
#  todo the data we have worth exposing?
  #  todo sm+jc - open a ticket (may already have one) to incorporate the ESCO taxonomy and add a CP section to get these for a given occupation at registration
