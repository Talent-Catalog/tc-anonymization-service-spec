type: object # todo - review these fields - do we need all of them?
#todo jc I think that we will have to if we want to expose similar functionality to users of the public anon db api
#todo sm user info is currently referenced only in IdentifiableCandidate.yaml, I don't think we want to expose it in the anon db
#todo sm begs the question what the purpose of the user schema - for instance I don't think we'd use them for login purposes through the api
#todo sm for api user authentication I thought we would use api keys, for example
